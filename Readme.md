 * You can order scripts, separators, and folders using a two digit prefix on the file name (two digit prefix not required).
 * It runs !AppleScripts, Automator Files (.workflow), Application Bundles, and Shell Scripts (sh/python/perl/whatever but remember you need executable permission for shell scripts).
